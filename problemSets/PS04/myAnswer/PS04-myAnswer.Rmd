\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We're interested in modeling the historical causes of child mortality. We have data from 26855 children born in Skellefte√•, Sweden from 1850 to 1884. Using the "child" dataset in the \texttt{eha} library, fit a Cox Proportional Hazard model using mother's age and infant's gender as covariates. Present and interpret the output.


\section*{\textcolor{blue}{My Answer}}

```{R}
library(eha)
data <- eha::child
cox_model <- coxreg(Surv(exit, event)~m.age+sex, data=data, coxph=TRUE)
summary(cox_model)
```
\textcolor{blue}{
The model's result suggests that both the mother's age at childbirth and the infant's gender are significant predictors of child mortality in this historical context. Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A slight but statistically significant increase in the risk of child mortality is associated with older maternal age at the time of birth.
	\item Female children have a significantly lower risk of mortality compared to male children in this population.
\end{enumerate}}
